### Assignment details  
Make a function that copies an array, ONLY accepting the items that are numbers.  

IT SHOULD RETURN A NEW ARRAY  

ex:  
```
var newArray = numbersOnly([1, "apple", -3, "orange", 0.5]);
// newArray is [1, -3, 0.5]
```

HINT  

Use typeof to determine type (ex: typeof 24 === "number" would be true)  

Bonus (Only If You Have Time):  

* Make a second function that removes them from the given array. (instead of copying to a new array)  
* Do you need to return the array?
